        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="My name is Edjeba Sunday">

        <p>Hello, my name is Sunday Edjeba. I am from Okpara Inland, Nigeria.

            I am a graduate of Delta State University, Abraka, where I earned a degree in Human
            Anatomy and Cell
            Biology. I am currently applying this foundational knowledge in my role as a
            Radiographer Assistant
            at Premium Hospital in Udu, Nigeria, where I gain firsthand, day-to-day experience with
            the
            strengths and limitations of healthcare software systems.

            Driven by a lifelong passion for technology and problem-solving, I am now pursuing my
            dream by
            studying Software and Web Development at Brigham Young University (BYU). My studies are
            guided by a
            clear mission: to leverage my unique perspective at the intersection of medicine and
            technology to
            design and build better, more intuitive healthcare software systems. My goal is to
            create solutions
            that address the real-world workflows and challenges faced by medical professionals,
            with the aim of
            improving efficiency and patient care not just in my own hospital, but for healthcare
            providers in
            general.

            My personal story is rooted in a large, loving family. I come from a polygamous family
            and am the
            youngest of seven children from my mother. This background has taught me invaluable
            lessons in
            resilience, adaptability, and understanding complex systems—skills I now apply daily,
            both in a busy
            hospital environment and to intricate coding challenges.

            Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I have a great love for music, movies, and
            sports.
            These passions fuel my creativity and appreciation for storytelling, design, and
            strategic thinking.
            At my core, I am a builder and a problem-solver. I am dedicated to writing programs that
            solve
            tangible, real-world problems.

            My journey is a purposeful fusion of biology, hands-on healthcare experience, and
            cutting-edge
            technology. I am driven by the goal of using everything I learn to create tools that
            empower medical
            professionals and enhance care delivery on a broader scale.
